# Natural Language Calculator and Story Problem Solver 
(Really nice openai function example!)

Who needs code interpreter when you can call my calculator here? 
Not too many dependencies! Calls a function iff needed, (here using a sympy evaluator) and you can substitute your own function without all the repetitive
coding; just include an effective function description with parameters and the code will do the rest!

Thank you to @kordless for getting me going here! https://gist.github.com/kordless/7d306b0646bf0b56c44ebca2b8e96678
